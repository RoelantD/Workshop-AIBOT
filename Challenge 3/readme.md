Welcome to the Seeing PI challenge. In this challenge you are going to create your own custom vision model and run it on your Raspberry PI.

### Challenge:
Make a program that runs on your Rapsberry PI and can detect 3 different objects.
- Use Custom Vision to train a model
- Use the motion sensor to trigger to detection
- Use the LED to show that the detection is in progress
- Display the result on the SPI Display
