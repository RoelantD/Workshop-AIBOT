# The Seeing PI Challenge #

Welcome to the Seeing PI challenge. In this challenge you are going to create your own custom vision model and run it on your Raspberry PI to detect objects.

> **Challenge**:   
> Make a program that runs on your Rapsberry PI and can detect 3 different objects.

### Requirements 
- Use Custom Vision to train a model
- Use the motion sensor to trigger to detection
- Use the LED to show that the detection is in progress
- Display the result on the SPI Display

# Part 1 - Create your model

#### Create your dataset
Find 3 objects in the room like your watch, phone, mouse, cup or any thing that classifies as an object.
Make at least 15 photos from these objects. Make sure you use different angles and backgrounds.
From the 15 pictures per object, set 2 aside for your 

#### Create a new project
Go to the website: [customvision.ai](https://www.customvision.ai) and login with a Microsoft account.
